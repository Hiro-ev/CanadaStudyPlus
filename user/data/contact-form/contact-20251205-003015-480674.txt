Message: Fantasy is dominating multiple bestseller categories in the children’s book section on Amazon — and the Creative Writing, Story Starters, and Write-Your-Own-Story Books niche for ages 8–12 is growing faster than ever.

If you browse through “Children’s Activity Books,” “Creative Writing,” and “Imagination &amp; Play,” you’ll see fantasy-themed story starter books consistently appearing on the first page — with both new and long-time authors releasing fresh titles every week. From “Write Your Own Fantasy Story” and “Kids Creative Writing Journal” to various “Build-A-Story Books,” the demand just keeps expanding.
